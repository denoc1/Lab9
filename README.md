# Lab9 - Random Phone Number

Write an application that creates and prints a random phone number of the form XXX-XXX-XXXX.  Include the dashes in the output.
Restrictions:   (These are not actual restrictions to our phone numbers, but we’ll address that later)
1.	The first group of three digits is called the area code.  The area code must be greater than or equal to 100, but it cannot contain an 8 or a 9.
2.	The second set of three digits cannot be greater than 742, but due to leading 0 issue, make it greater than or equal to 100.
3.	The last four digits need to be random – from 1000 to 9999.    

Hint:  Think through the easiest way to construct the phone number.  

The output should be something similar to
A random phone number is 403-721-0250

Submission instructions:
1.	Documentation header – Include documentation at the top of the file including your name and assignment name:  “Lab #9 – Random Phone numbers” and the date you submitted it.
2.	Documentation through the program – include comments throughout your code explaining your process/steps for a reader to understand clearly what you are doing.  Every line does not need a comment, but anytime you do something integral to the program, there should be a comment summarizing the purpose.
